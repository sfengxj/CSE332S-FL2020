2. Expects 6 arguments, 5 user entered numbers plus one. Ten winning numbers will be generated.
3. Running with 5 arguments doesn't terminate, which means there's an infinite loop, unending recursion, or similar problem in the 
code. To fix it, we add breakpoints and use the debugger to find the place it gets stuck. We guessed that the problem was occuring in
the insertion sort method

4. When we re-ran it, the program crashed with a vector subscript out of range error. We now look for where that issue occurs.

CSE 332S - Debugging practice

This program plays a simple lottery game. A user inputs their chosen numbers on the command line (1-MAXNUMBER). The program then:
1. generates a list of winning numbers
2. sorts that list
3. uses binary search on the sorted list to determine how many user chosen numbers match the winning numbers
4. outputs the winning numbers and whether or not the user won(you win if more than half of the numbers you supply via the command line are winning numbers) 

Possible program return values:
Enums for theses can be found in lottery.h
0 - NOTAWINNER
1 - WINNER
2 - JACKPOT 
-1 - INCORRECTUSAGE

Program parameters and their default values:
Enum for these can be found in lottery.h
MAXNUMBER = 100   (numbers generated by the program will range from 1 - MAXNUMBER)
WINNINGNUMBERS = 10 (how many winning numbers will be generated)
USERNUMBERS = 5 (how many user supplied numbers the program expects, as command line arguments)
